    <h1>BMI</h1>
    <p>
A Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is a simple tool used to estimate a person's 
body fat based on their weight and height. It is a commonly used metric in healthcare 
and fitness to quickly assess whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. 
    </p>
    <h1>Interpretation</h1>
    <p>BMI below 18.5: <i>Underweight</i></p>
      <p>BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: <i>Normal weight</i></p>
      <p>BMI between 25.0 and 29.9: <i>Overweight</i></p>
      <p>BMI of 30 or higher: <i>Obese</i></p>
      <p>It's important to note that BMI has its limitations. 
        It does not take into account factors like <mark><em>muscle mass, bone density,
         or distribution of weight, all of which can affect a person's health.</em></mark> 
         As a result, it is a rough estimate and should not be the sole determinant of a person's health status.</p>
         <p>Additionally, BMI may not be suitable for certain populations, such as <mark><em>athletes or older adults</em></mark>, as their body 
          composition can be different from the general population.</p>
          <p>Despite its limitations, BMI remains a widely used tool because it's simple, quick, 
            and can provide a general indication of whether a person's weight falls within a healthy range.
             However, it's important to use it in conjunction with other assessments and consult with a healthcare professional 
             for a comprehensive evaluation of one's health and fitness.</p>

             <p style=" font-size: 19px; margin-top: 1rem;"><b>A "good" BMI, in the context of health and well-being, generally falls within the normal weight range.
               Here are steps you can take to achieve and maintain a healthy BMI:</b></p></mat-card>
               <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><mark><b>1. Set Realistic Goals:</b></mark> Determine a healthy and achievable BMI range for your age and gender.
                 It's important to set realistic goals, as an overly low BMI can be just as harmful as an excessively high one.</p>

                 <P><mark><b>2. Balanced Diet:</b></mark> Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods. 
                  Consume fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats in appropriate portions. 
                  Avoid excessive consumption of processed foods, sugary beverages, and high-fat, high-calorie items</P>

                  <p><mark><b>3. Calorie Control:</b></mark> Monitor your calorie intake and maintain a calorie balance that aligns with your goals. 
                    To lose weight, create a calorie deficit (consume fewer calories than you burn); to maintain your weight,
                     maintain a balance; and to gain weight (if underweight), consume more calories than you burn.</p>

                     <p><mark><b>4. Regular Exercise:</b></mark> Engage in regular physical activity. 
                      A combination of aerobic exercise (e.g., walking, jogging, swimming) and strength training can help you manage your weight, 
                      increase muscle mass, and improve overall health.</p>
